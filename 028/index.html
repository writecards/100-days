他写信给我：回程经过千叶海岸时，我想起了清少纳言的清单，所有那些只要说出名字就能让人心跳加快的事物，只需说出名字。对我们来说，太阳不够是太阳，除非它是光芒四射的；春天不够是春天，除非它是清澈的。在这里，添加形容词就像在购买的物品上留下价格标签一样粗鲁。日本诗歌从不修饰。有一种方式可以说船、石头、雾、青蛙、乌鸦、冰雹、苍鹭、菊花，这些都包含在其中。最近报纸上充满了一个名古屋男人的故事。他爱的人去年去世了，他疯狂地埋头工作——日本式的——像疯子一样。似乎他甚至在电子学方面做出了重要的发现。然后在五月，他自杀了。据说他无法忍受听到“春天”这个词。他向我描述了他与东京的重逢：就像一只刚从度假归来的猫，一回到自己的篮子里就立刻开始巡视熟悉的地方。他跑去看看一切是否都在它们应该在的地方：银座的猫头鹰，新桥的火车头，三越百货顶上的狐狸神社——他发现那里被小女孩和摇滚歌手占据了。有人告诉他，现在是小女孩们在制造和解散明星；制片人们在她们面前颤抖。有人告诉他，一个毁容的女人在路人面前摘下面具，如果他们不认为她漂亮，她就会抓伤他们。他对一切都感兴趣。他对道奇队是否赢得冠军赛或每日双赛的结果毫不关心，却急切地询问千代之富士在上次相扑比赛中的表现。他打听皇室的消息，皇太子的情况，东京最老的黑帮老大，他经常上电视教孩子们善良。这些简单的快乐他从未感受过：回到一个国家，一个家，一个家庭住宅。但一千二百万匿名的居民可以给他这些。

他写道：东京是一座被电线捆绑的城市，她展示了她的脉络。有人说电视让她的人民变得不识字；至于我，我从未见过这么多人在街上看书。也许他们只在街上看书，或者他们只是装作在看书——这些黄皮肤的人。我在新宿的大书店纪伊国屋约见。那种让日本人在电影发明前十个世纪就发明了宽银幕电影的图形天才，多少弥补了一点漫画女主人公的悲惨命运，她们是无情故事作者和阉割审查制度的受害者。有时她们会逃脱，你会在墙上再次找到她们。整个城市就是一部漫画；这是漫画星球。怎能不认出从塑料化的巴洛克到斯大林风格的雕像？还有那些巨大的面孔，眼睛沉重地压在漫画书读者身上，比人还大的画面，偷窥着偷窥者。

夜幕降临时，这座大都市分解成一个个村庄，有银行阴影下的乡村墓地，有车站和神社。东京的每个区再次变成一个整洁天真的小镇，安静地依偎在摩天大楼之间。
        <!-- He described me his reunion with Tokyo: like a cat who has come home from vacation in his basket immediately starts to inspect familiar places. He ran off to see if everything was where it should be: the Ginza owl, the Shimbashi locomotive, the temple of the fox at the top of the Mitsukoshi department store, which he found invaded by little girls and rock singers. He was told that it was now little girls who made and unmade stars; the producers shuddered before them. He was told that a disfigured woman took off her mask in front of passers-by and scratched them if they did not find her beautiful. Everything interested him. He who didn't give a damn if the Dodgers won the pennant or about the results of the Daily Double asked feverishly how Chiyonofuji had done in the last sumo tournament. He asked for news of the imperial family, of the crown prince, of the oldest mobster in Tokyo who appears regularly on television to teach goodness to children. These simple joys he had never felt: of returning to a country, a house, a family home. But twelve million anonymous inhabitants could supply him with them.


        He wrote: Tokyo is a city crisscrossed by trains, tied together with electric wire she shows her veins. They say that television makes her people illiterate; as for me, I've never seen so many people reading in the streets. Perhaps they read only in the street, or perhaps they just pretend to read—these yellow men. I make my appointments at Kinokuniya, the big bookshop in Shinjuku. The graphic genius that allowed the Japanese to invent CinemaScope ten centuries before the movies compensates a little for the sad fate of the comic strip heroines, victims of heartless story writers and of castrating censorship. Sometimes they escape, and you find them again on the walls. The entire city is a comic strip; it's Planet Manga. How can one fail to recognize the statuary that goes from plasticized baroque to Stalin central? And the giant faces with eyes that weigh down on the comic book readers, pictures bigger than people, voyeurizing the voyeurs.
        At nightfall the megalopolis breaks down into villages, with its country cemeteries in the shadow of banks, with its stations and temples. Each district of Tokyo once again becomes a tidy ingenuous little town, nestling amongst the skyscrapers. -->
